# Bitcoin Prediction Algorithm

## CryptoCurrency prediction using Deep Recurrent Neural Networks

This repository contains various Machine learning models used in industry to predict stock prices and cryptocurrency in finance industry.

- Fundamental analysis of Bitcoin prices using Yahoo Finance
- Recurrent Neural Networks / Long Short Term Memory Networks
- Scraper for Bitcoin data using the CryptoCompare API

Install
This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- Keras

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

## Code
The source code is divided into multiple sections following the machine learning design pattern of data exploration, training, and testing. The precompiled version of the notebook can be viewed, or rerun the entire notebook.

## Run
In a terminal or command window, run one of the following commands:

jupyter notebook BitcoinPrediction.ipynb

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in the browser.

## Data
BitCoin Price Data from August 2019 - July 2020. The prices are based on coinbase cryptoexchange. Some values were missing and a forward strategy was used to fill the said missing values.

**Features** Bitcoin Price Data from August 2019 - July 2020

**Target** Variable Close Price: Close price of Bitcoin for each day
